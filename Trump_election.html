                When voting for a presidential candidate, what are the crucial factors that you consider? 
                It may be tax policies, higher minimum wage, pro-renewable energy, and so on... 
                In the end, it all comes down to the financial wellbeing of the voter. For example, 
                a worker in the oil industry may agree with Joe Biden's political agenda, but he would 
                still vote for Donald Trump because of the financial impact he will have to suffer if 
                Joe Biden becomes the president who publicly announced that he stop funds for the oil 
                industry.

            <p> Having said that, in the election of 2016 Trump was able to win the election by planning 
                out policies that will  financially benefit more people. His main target was white people,
                 who make up more than 73% of the US population. In other categories, however, Trump 
                 lost to Clinton allowing her to win the popular vote. Nonetheless, Donald Trump was 
                 able to win the presidency by taking strategic advantage of electoral college votes.

            <p>
                In the case of the 2020 election, his sole ground of white voters(both non-college educated 
                and college educated) shifted significantly towards Democrats. While 32% of white 
                non-college voters supported Democrats in the 2016 election, in 2020 36% of white 
                non-college voters supported the democratic party. Such swing among white non-college 
                voters who makes up more than 44% of the whole voting population was a huge defeat for 
                Trump's presidential campaign. It is noteworthy to mention only voters with $100k+ 
                inclined towards Republicans while people making under $100k shifted towards Democrats.

                So, the question is, what has caused Trump to lose his ground of white voters? 
                And the answer to that is the Trump administration's dependence in the oil industry. 
                Of course, a major factor to consider is how Trump handled the  pandemic, but I would 
                like to only focus on the oil industry since it consists more than 10% of GDP growth 
                in the US(in the year 2018 according to the National Bureau of Economic Research).

                The graph above shows two major troughs in 2008 and 2020. The year 2008 was when 
                Lehman Brothers Holding  collapsed and caused a financial crisis, which can be 
                interpreted as a trough in the business cycle. After such economic depression, 
                the US enjoyed a large expansion period only going through minor hindrances. The 
                Year 2017, when the Trump administration took over the presidency, was yet another 
                expansion period suitable for his slogan of "Make America Great Again". To continue
                such expansion trend, Trump administration sought to invest large portion of its funds
                 into shale industry.

            <p>
                Shale oil extraction is profitable if the oil price is above $40, and since the oil price rarely goes 
                below $40 it seemed very logical to invest in such field: More oil meant More money! US oil companies would be able 
                to make a profit yielding to large economic growth, and for other US companies, spending domestic oil rather than imported 
                oil played another huge role in GDP growth. Note the significant drop in year 2014, this accounts for the point where shale
                 oil became profitable.

                Thus Trump administration took the opportunity of investing great funds towards the oil industry and as a result, 
                the United States was the number 1 oil-producing country. Note that starting from 2017, there is a dramatic increase in oil production.

                However, expansion period can't be forever, the economy will have to go through a recession period; It is just a question of when? 
                and how? Although this time, it was a pandemic that will impact the entire humanity, unlike any past circumstances. Most countries failed 
                to successfully contain the virus, and as a result of that economy crashed,  literally. People didn't go out as much, which caused reduced employment, 
                which caused less money to spend, which caused reduced employment, and so on, the money cycle that had supported the social system had failed. Such a 
                vicious cycle yielded less production of goods which ultimately causes a steep decline in oil price.

            <p>
                The dramatic drop of oil price which makes up more than 10% of the US GDP with the combination of dampened  consumer spending is responsible for the significant downfall 
                of 2020 US GDP. Trump administration's plan of using shale oil to "make America great again" seemed reasonable, but encountered very unexpected circumstance which resulted
                 in crashing the economic status of America. Of course, the main reason for his defeat in the election of 2020 is due to failure to contain the virus, but also Trump invested 
                 in the declining industry without taking insurance of splitting funds taking too risky leverage. As a result, former Trump supporters, especially in the rust belt states, 
                 suffered financially which led them to vote Biden over Trump. The previous statement obvious has logical leap, however, such failure in fund allocation definitely 
                 played a major role in his defeat.
